# Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World

Author: Vivek H. Murthy, MD

- Chapter 3: Cultures of Connection
    - Women and Loneliness
        
        Femininity in most cultures is rooted in relationships. When relationships fail, girls and women tend to blame themselves. The resulting shame and loneliness are even more acute when women have blurred their sense of self in service of those relationships.
        
        Girls have a feeling of constant comparison. This exposes them to the shame of social failure and increases their risk of loneliness. There's a fear of missing out, yet you can never keep up.
        
        Girls' friendships are often intense, confusing, frustrating, and humiliating. 
        
        Despite the different cultural expectations that men and women absorb as they come of age, the truth is that people don't fall neatly into categories of social behavior or attitudes. 
        
        Gendered norms may be deeply influential for some people, but others are more affected by factors such as personality or the particular attitudes within their families. 
        
        It's important to recognize that the broader cultural layers surrounds us all, dovetailing with other cultural imperatives to shape the ease, frequency, and quality of our social connections, as well as our relative risk for loneliness. 
        
        Evolution is slow to catch up with rapid societal change. We no longer live in a world of isolated and insular tribes and villages. We no longer have any rational justification for attacking or excluding others simply because they don't look like us. We're still wired as if all those conditions were true, but they're not. 
        
        Isolation costs us in terms of perspective and experience. 
        
        We've emphasized freedom of individual expression without also ensuring that the underpinnings of community are protected and strengthened. 
        
        Giving and serving others doesn't just strengthen our communities, it enriches our lives and strengthens our own bonds to the community and our sense of value and purpose. 
        
        Kindness can bridge the divides between us, healing our society even as it relieves our personal loneliness and brings up together. 
        
- Chapter 6: Relating inside out
    - Self-Knowledge
        
        It is often much easier to gain insight and perspective into others than into ourselves because knowledge requires a degree of objectivity which is difficulty to summon when we are the subject of concern. 
        
        We tend to learn more about ourselves during pivotal phases of our lives, when aspects of our character are tested and revealed in new and varies situations.
        
        Self awareness can help us find constructive ways to address that discomfort of certain traits of our personality or behavior. 
        
        Everyone needs meaningful relationships; it's just that the preferred pace, frequency, and intensity of engagement vary depending on where we fall along the spectrum. 
        
        Our identity, preferences, and needs will evolve, sometimes under stress and duress, and in order to stay whole, grounded, and securely connected with ourselves despite thee fluctuations, we need an added steam of self-compassion. 
        
    - Self-Compassion
        
        In Tibetan culture it is a foreign concept to not be compassionate and loving toward yourself. 
        
        Self compassion is what shields us from the judgement and ridicule of people who don't understand us.
        
        Forgive yourself for those moments when you haven't lived up to your expectations or desires. 
        
    - Moments of Pause
        
        Amid all this turbulence, solitude can seem boring, wasteful, or simply impossible.
        
        The practice of self-reflection can take the form of meditation or prayer, a nature walk, or simply a few minutes of silent contemplation in a park, during our work commute, or before we go to bed at night.
        
        By allowing our minds to wander without an agenda or destination, we learn to read our emotions and sensations, to listen to our bodies and trace our thoughts.
        
        Pausing, it turns out, is what sustains the heart.
        
        This relationship with others and with a larger universe is a connection that we all instinctively crave, because belonging involves more than being accepted, known, and loved; it also means sharing in the concern and responsibility for others.
        
        We each have a lot to offer. And when we reach out to one another from a place of self-knowledge and compassion, we have the power to transform our lives and heal the world.
        
    - Middle Circle: Occasional Companions
        
        Middle-circle friends provide a vital buffer against Relational loneliness.
        
        Most of us can form new middle-circle friendships just as we did when we were kids: by joining groups.
        
        When we share laughter, we feel happier, more familiar with those around us, and more at ease.
        
        Humor creates a powerful bond among people who all find the same thing funny.
        
    - Outer Circle: Colleagues and Acquaintances
        
        These outer-circle relationships are the amicable acquaintances we build through occasional interactions on the job, in our neighborhoods, through civic and social organizations, places of worship, or online. Over time, they can evolve into friends.
        
    - Connecting at Work
        
        We need meaningful connections at work but often these friendships require an encouraging nudge.
        
        In many companies, individualism dominates despite the fact that most work enterprise requires collective effort. 
        
        When we're energized and engaged at work, it leads to productivity.
        
        People fear that if they ask for help, they’re going to be perceived as needy, incompetent, weak, or ignorant. They think that admitting they have a problem is going to harm their reputation.
        
        The commitment to people both on their best days and their worst allows people to bring their whole selves to work.
        
        Not everyone Amanda knows through her work at Zingerman’s has become a close friend, but what matters is that all who work there are indeed friends.
        
        A manager is having a conversation with a dishwasher, which is a perfectly normal human behavior, but would not happen in other organizations.”
        
    - The Kindness of Strangers
        
        Momentary high-quality interactions can make people more likely to share information and resources and to help one another. Our social universe is filled with strangers, and our interactions with them can also help stave off loneliness and make us feel more connected. Extroverts and introverts alike enjoy conversations with strangers.
        
        Kind interactions with strangers remind us of our self-worth and purpose for others.
        
        Invite connection by giving people permission to admit they would welcome engagement with strangers.
        
        We share the risk of loneliness and the power to prevent it.
        
        It shouldn’t take a tragedy for strangers to meet and help on another.
        
        Community can be a vital resource not just in moments of public anxiety but in quiet, private times of need too.
        
- Chapter 8: A Family of Families
    
    The future will depend on our children. Our youngest generations are growing up amid a barrage of cultural messages that prioritize fame, wealth, and status at the expense of kindness, honesty, and character. 
    
    Small children who are treated kindly generally reflect that treatment.
