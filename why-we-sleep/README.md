    ### Sleep in midlife and old age
    
    - That older adults simply need less sleep is a myth.
    - The core impairments of sleep that occur with again are
        - Reduced quantity/quality.
        - Reduced sleep efficiency.
        - Disrupted timing of sleep.
    - Sleep efficiency is the percent of time you were sleep while in bed. If you were in bed for 8 hours and slept for 4, your sleep efficiency would be 50%. Most sleep doctors consider a good-quality sleep to involve a sleep efficiency of 90 percent or above.
    - The lower an individual's sleep efficiency score, the higher the mortality risk, the worse their physical health, the more likely they are to suffer from depression, the less energy they report, and the lower their cognitive function, typified by forgetfulness.
    - The parts of our brain that ignite healthy deep sleep at night are the very same areas that degenerate, or atrophy, earliest and most severely as we age.

    ### Sleep to forget?
    
    Forgetting lowers the brain resources required for retrieving memories we want to retain, similar to the ease of finding important documents on a neatly organized, clutter-free desk. 
    
    Sleep does not offer a general, nonspecific preservation of all the information you learn during the day. It offers a far more discerning hand in memory improvement. It preferentially picks and chooses what information is ultimately strengthens. How this is done remains unclear.

    - Tired and forgetful?
        
        > In other words, if you don’t sleep the very first night after learning, you lose the chance to consolidate those memories, even if you get lots of “catch-up” sleep thereafter.

    - Sleep and Alzheimer's disease
        
        Dementia and cancer are related to inadequate sleep.
        
        Sleep disturbance precedes the onset of Alzheimer's disease by several years.
        
        We now recognize that sleep disruption can initiate and or accelerate the condition.
        
        The disease is associated with the buildup of a toxic form of protein called beta-amyloid. This plaque is poisonous to neurons, killing the surrounding brain cells.
        
        Without sufficient sleep, amyloid plaques build up in the brain, especially in the deep-sleep-generating regions, attacking and degrading them. 
        
        More amyloid, less deep sleep, less deep sleep, more amyloid. 
        
        **Getting too little sleep across the adult life span will significantly raise your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Prioritizing sleep across the life span may be a significant factor for lowering Alzheimer's disease risk.**
        
        Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were very vocal about sleeping only four to five hours, later on developed the disease.

    - Sleep Deprivation and the Body
        
        Careful eating and exercise become less effective if you are not sleeping enough. The effects of sleep deprivation will seep into every nook and cranny of biology, even altering your DNA.
        
        The shorter you sleep, the shorter your life.
        
        Unhealthy sleep, unhealthy heart.
        
        Lack of sleep puts your sympathetic nervous system into overdrive. This places a strain on your body, which leads to health issues. 
        
        Deep sleep prevents an escalation of physiological stress that is synonymous with increased blood pressure, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke
        
        The switch to daylight savings time in March results in most people losing an hour of sleep opportunity, this comes with a  spike in heart attacks the following day. 
        
        In the autumn, when the clocks move forward and we gain an hour of sleep opportunity time, rates of heart attacks plummet the day after.
        
    - Sleep loss and metabolism: Diabetes and weight gain
        
        The less you sleep, the more likely you are to eat.
        
        Chronic sleep deprivation is now recognized as one of the major contributors to the escalation of type 2 diabetes.
        
        Not enough sleep will decrease concentrations of leptin (the I'm full signal) and increase levels of ghrelin (the I'm still hungry signal). You simply will not feel satisfied by food when short sleeping.
        
        A sleep-deprived body will cry famine in the midst of plenty.
        
        Sleep loss increases levels of circulating endocannabinoids, which stimulate appetite. 
        
        Combine this increase and the alteration in leptin and ghrelin you get overeating. 
        
        It is not true that because we stay awake longer we burn extra calories. Sleep is an intensely metabolically active state for brain and body alike.
        
        The less an individual sleeps, the less energy they feel, the more sedentary and less willing to exercise they are in. Inadequate sleep is the perfect recipe for obesity: greater calories intake, lower calorie expenditure. 
        
        The encouraging news is that getting enough sleep will help you control body weight. Ample sleep can restore a system of impulse control within your brain.
        
        When you are not getting enough sleep, the body becomes especially stingy about giving up fat. 
        
        If you diet and don't sleep enough, you will lose muscle, if you diet and sleep enough, you will lose fat. 
        
        Short sleep will prevent effective weight loss when dieting. 
        
    - Sleep loss and the reproductive system
        
        Short sleeping degrades reproductive hormones, reproductive organs, and the very nature of physical attractiveness. 
        
    - Sleep loss, genes, and DNA
        
        Thousands of genes within the brain depend upon consistent and sufficient sleep for their stable regulation.

        Scientists can now classify dreams.
