# Part I: The Technological Challenge

<aside>
üì¢ Humankind is losing faith in the liberal story that dominated global politics in recent decades, exactly when the merger of biotech and infotech confront us with the biggest challenges humankind has ever encountered.

</aside>

- **1: Disillusionment**
    - It is much harder to struggle against irrelevance than against exploitation.
    - Democracy is based on Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs principle that ‚Äúyou can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time‚Äù.
    - If the nation is facing external invasion or diabolical subversion, who has time to worry about overcrowded hospitals and polluted rivers?
    - Liberalism cherishes liberty, but liberty has different meanings in different contexts.
    
    |  | THE LIBERAL SET MENU |  |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |  | NATIONAL LEVEL | INTERNATIONAL LEVEL |
    | Economic field | Free markets, privatization, low taxes | Free trade, global integration, low tariffs |
    | Political field | Free elections, rule
    of law, minority rights | Peaceful relations,
    multilateral cooperation, international laws and organizations |
    | Personal field | Free choices, individualism, diversity, gender equality | Ease of personal movement and migration. |
    - About the Liberal Set Menu
        - If a country wants to enjoy one dish from the liberal set menu, it has no choice but to take the other dishes too.
        - The one dish that almost everybody wants, at least in theory, is peaceful international relations.
        - The one dish that almost nobody desires is immigration.
    - The liberal story always insisted that the liberal system is a living organism made of mutually dependent organs.
    - Perhaps even Westerners should take a break from trying to run the world and focus on their own affairs for a change.
    - MAGA: As if the USA of the 1980s or 1950s was a perfect society that Americans should somehow recreate in the 21st century.
    - Obama said: The principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law‚Ä¶ remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century.
    - Most humans never enjoyed greater peace or prosperity than they did under the aegis of the liberal order of the early 21st century.
    - Liberalism has no obvious answers to the biggest problems we face ecological collapse and technological disruption.
    - Economic growth will not solve technological disruption, for is predicated on the invention of more and more disruptive technologies.
    - Panic is a form a hubris. It comes from the smug feeling that one knows exactly where the world is heading: down. Bewilderment is more humble and therefore more clearsighted.
    - The revolution in IT and biotechnology are still in their infancy, and it is debatable to what extent they are really responsible for the current crisis of liberalism.
- **2: Work**
    - Fears that automation will create massive unemployment go back to the 19th century, and so far, they have never been materialized. Yet there are good reasons to think that this time it is different, and that machine learning will be the real game changer. AI is now beginning to outperform humans in more and more cognitive skills, including the understanding of human emotions. The better we understand the biochemical mechanisms that underpin human emotions, desires, choices, the better computers can become in analyzing human behavior, predicting human decisions, and replacing human drivers, bankers, and lawyers.
    - Human intuition is in reality pattern recognition. The biochemical algorithms of the human brain are far from perfect. They rely on heuristics, shortcuts, and outdated circuits adapter to the African savannah rather than to the urban jungle.
        - Therefore, AI is really competing against neutral networking and not human soul or mystical hunches.
    - AI possesses connectivity and updatability; abilities humans do not have.
        - Computers are not individuals and it‚Äôs easy to integrate them into a single flexible network.
        - We should compare the abilities of a collection of human individuals to the abilities of an integrated network.
    - Replacing all human drivers with computers is expected to reduce deaths and injuries on the road by 90 percent.
        - What we ultimately ought to protect is humans, not jobs.
    - The human care industry is likely to remain a human bastion for a long time.
        - Doctors are likely to be replaced by AI before nurses.
    - Emotions are the result of a biochemical process.
    - 
    
    ### The Mozart in the Machine
    
    - Out of all art forms, music is the most susceptible to Big Data analysis.
        - The inputs are mathematical patterns of sound waves.
        - The outputs are the electrochemical patterns of neural storms.
        - Algorithms may learn to compose entire tunes, playing on human emotions as if they were a piano keyboard. Which you alone in the entire universe would appreciate. But how could you sing or dance together to a song nobody besides you knows?
        - If art is really about inspiring (or manipulating) human emotions, few if any human musicians will be able to compete with such an algorithm, because they cannot match it in understanding the chief instrument they're playing on: the human biochemical system.
        - 
    
    ### New Jobs?
    
    - The job market of 2050 might well be characterized by human-AI cooperation rather than competition. Even if probability of systemic mass unemployment is low, we should take it very seriously.
        - Yesterday‚Äôs sidekicks might morph into tomorrow‚Äôs superintendent, and all protocols and manuals will have to be rewritten each year.
        - New jobs will probably demand high levels of expertise. Creating new human jobs might prove easier than retraining humans to actually fill these jobs.
        - Many people might share the fate of nineteenth-century horses, who were increasingly pushed out of the job market altogether.
        - The challenge posed to humankind in the twenty-first century by infotech and biotech is arguably much bigger than the challenge posed in the previous era by steam engines, railroads, and electricity.
    
    ### From Exploitation to Irrelevance
    
    - Preventing job losses altogether means giving up the immense positive potential of AI and robotics.
        - ‚ÄúProtect workers, not jobs‚Äù
        - How do you start a working-class revolution without a working class?
        - Today computers and algorithms are already beginning to function as clients in addition to being producers.
            - In the stock exchange algorithms are becoming the most important buyers of bonds, shares, and commodities.
            - When people design web pages, they often cater to the taste of the Google search algorithm rather than to the taste of any human being.
        - The most successful ice cream vendors in the world are those that the google algorithm ranks first.
        - We should focus on providing for people‚Äô basic needs and protecting their social status and self-worth.
            - Universal basic income (the capitalist paradise) or universal basic services (the communist paradise).
            - 
    
    ### What is Universal?
    
    - When people speak of universal basic support, they usually mean national basic support. The problem with this is main victims of automation may not live in these nations.
        - Globalization has made people in one country utterly dependent on markets in other countries, but automation might unravel large parts of this global trade network with disastrous on sequences for the weakest link.
        - What do you do when nobody needs your cheap unskilled laborers, and you don't have the resources to build a good education system and teach them new skills?
    
    ### What is basic?
    
    - There is no basic accepted definition for what basic human needs are.
        - In medieval Europe, access to church services was seen as even more important than food.
        - The quest for meaning and community might eclipse the quest for a job.
        - What we should worry about even more is the shift in authority from human to algorithms.
- **3: Liberty**
    
    ### Big Data is watching you
    
    - The liberal story cherishes human liberty as its number one value.
        - If democracy were a matter of rational decision making, there would be absolutely no reason to give all people equal voting rights.
        - Democracy assumes that human feelings reflect a mysterious and profound free will, that this free will is the ultimate source of authority, and that while some people are more intelligent than others, all humas are equally free.
        - The reliance on the heart might prove to be the Achilles heel of liberal democracy.
    
    ### Listen to the Algorithm
    
    - Feelings aren‚Äôt based on intuition, inspiration, or freedom‚Äî they are based on calculation.
        - Feelings of sexual attraction arise when other biochemical algorithms calculate that nearby individual offers a high probability of successful mating, social bonding, or some other coveted goal.
        - When the biotech revolution merges with the infotech revolution, it will produce Big Data algorithms that can monitor and understand my feelings much better than I can, and then authority will probably shift from humans to computers.
        - bxcxd=ahh!
            - biological knowledge multiplied by computing power multiplied by data equal ability to hack humans
    
    ### The drama of decision making
    
    - self-reporting is a notoriously unreliable gauge for people‚Äôs true preferences.
        - Most people don‚Äôt know themselves very well, and most people often make terrible mistakes in the most important decisions of their lives.
        - Within a mere two decades, billions of people have come to entrust the Google search algorithm with one of the most important tasks of all: searching for relevant trustworthy information.
        - As authority shifts from humans to algorithms, we might perceive the entire universe as a flow of data, see organisms as little more than biochemical algorithm, and believe that humanity‚Äôs cosmic vocation is to create an all-encompassing data-processing system and merge into it.
    
    ### The Philosophical Car
    
    - People‚Äôs merit should be judged by their actual behavior rather than by their religious affiliation and philosophical views.
        - What was good for survival and reproduction in the African savannah a million years ago does not necessarily make for responsible behavior on twenty-first-century motorways.
        - Computer algorithm have not been shaped by natural selection.
            - A human manager might subconsciously discriminate.
            - A computer does not have a subconscious, and cannot, unless programmed to do so.
        - Customers might be able to buy the car that best fits their favorite philosophical view.
    
    ### Digital Dictatorship
    
    - We should fear robots not because they will rebel but because they will probably always obey their masters.
        - There is nothing wrong with blind obedience as long as robots serve benign masters.
            - Robots always reflect the code qualities of their code.
            - The real problem with robots is the natural stupidity and cruelty of their human masters.
        - In the twenty first century we might face a growing problem of individual discrimination.
        - At the highest level of authority, we will probably retain human figureheads, however the decisions taken by them with be shaped by AI.
    
    ### Artificial intelligence and natural stupidity
    
    - Science fiction tends to confuse intelligence with consciousness and assume that in order to match or supas human intelligence computer will have to develop consciousness.
        - Intelligence is the ability to solve problems.
        - Consciousness is the ability to feel things.
        - In human and other mammals, these go hand in hand.
        - Computers solve problems in a different way. Just as planes fly faster than birds without ever developing feathers, so computer may come to solve problems much better than mammals without developing feelings.
            - We know so little about consciousness, it seems unlikely we could program it into computers anytime soon.
        
        <aside>
        üì¢ If we invest too much in developing AI and too little in developing human consciousness, the very sophisticated AI might only serve to empower the natural stupidity of humans. If we are not careful, we will end up with downgraded humans misusing upgraded computers to wreak havoc on themselves and on the world.
        
        </aside>
        
    
    <aside>
    üì¢ Expand and diversify your compassion.
    
    </aside>
    
    <aside>
    üì¢ Irrelevance is worse than exploitation.
    
    </aside>
    
- **4: Equality**
    
    ### Those who own the data own the future
    
    - Inequality goes back to the Stone Age.
        - As human gained ownership of land, animals, plants, and tools, rigid hierarchical societies emerged, in which small elites monopolized most wealth and power for generation after generation.
        - Today the richest 1 percent own half the world‚Äôs wealth.
        - Technology might make it possible to translate economic inequality into biological inequality.
        - By 2100, the richest 1 percent might also own most of the world‚Äôs beauty, creativity, and health.
        - Maybe one of our biggest problems is that different human groups have completely different futures.
    - 
    
    ### Who owns the data?
    
    - In the twenty-first century, data will eclipse both land and machinery a the most important asset, and politics will be a struggle to control the flow of data.
    

# Part II: The Political Challenge

<aside>
üì¢ The merger of infotech and biotech threatens the core modern values of liberty and equality. Any solution to the technological challenge ha to involve global cooperation. But nationalism, religion, and culture divide humankind into hostile camps and make it very difficult to cooperate on a global level.

</aside>

- **5: Community**
    
    <aside>
    üì¢ If you don‚Äôt feel at home in your body, you will never feel at home in the world.
    
    </aside>
    
    ### Humans have bodies
    
    - The sociopolitical upheavals of our time result to a large extent from the disintegration of human communities.
        - In order to flourish, we still need to ground ourselves in intimate communities. If not, we feel lonely and alienated.
        - People live ever more lonely lives in an ever more connected planet.
        - You can hardly build a global community when you make money from capturing people‚Äôs attention and selling it to advertisers.
            - We should urge other corporation, institutions, and governments to challenge Facebook by making their own ideological commitments.
    
    ### Online versus offline
    
    - It is easier than ever to talk my cousin in Switzerland but harder than ever to talk to my husband over breakfast.
        - In the past, humans could not afford such carelessness.
        - What we feel is increasingly determined by online reactions.
        - We may come to miss the good old days when online was separated from offline.
        - 
        
    
- **6: Civilization**
    - **There is just one civilization in the world**
        - We insist that our values are a previous legacy from ancient ancestors. Yet the only thing that allows us to say that is that our ancestors are long dead and cannot speak for themselves.
            - European civilization is anything Europeans make of it. Same goes for Christians. Islam is anything Muslims make of it.
    - **Germans and gorillas**
        - Then thousand years ago humankind was divided into countless isolated tribes. With each passing millennium, these fused into larger and larger groups, creating fewer distinct civilizations. Political, ethic, cultural, and economic divisions endure, but they do not undermine the fundamental unity.
            - War spreads ideas, technologies, and people far more quickly than commerce does.
            - People care more about their war enemies than their trade partners.
            - War makes people far more interested in other another.
    - **The medieval Olympics**
        - Each country in the world has an anthem that conforms to the same universal model. When you watch the Tokyo Games 2020, remember that this seeming competition between nations actually represents an astonishing global agreement.
            - National flags display the same dreary conformity.
            - Numerous guerilla forces and terror organizations have managed to establish new countries or to conquer existing ones, but they have done so by accepting the fundamental principle of the global political order.
    - **One dollar to rule them all**
        - The people we fight most often are our own family member. Identify is defined by conflicts and dilemmas more than by agreements.
            - Whatever changes wait us, they are likely to involve fraternal struggle within a single civilization than a clash between alien civilization.
            - We are all members of a single rowdy global civilization.
            - If globalization brings with it so many problems, why not just abandon it?
            
        - People still have different religions and national identities. When it comes to the practical tuff, almost all of us belong to the same civilization.
            - If we happen to be sick, it makes much less difference where you live.
            - Trust in the dollar and in the wisdom of the Federal Reserver is so firm that it is shared even by Islamic fundamentalists, Mexican drug lord, and North Korean tyrants.
            
    
- **7: Nationalism**
    
    ### Global Problems Need Global Answers
    
    Groups increasingly support nationalistic isolation, yet the whole of humankind now constitutes a single civilization with all people sharing common challenges and opportunities. 
    
    Humans are social animals however for millions of years humans lived in small intimate communities rather than in large nation-states. These nation-states are only one option on the sapiens menu, and we know no upper limit to the size of a group with which people can identify. 
    
    Small tribes could not deal with certain challenges and opportunities, like those faced by ancient tribes that lived along the Nile River. This is why they went through the trouble of constructing large collectives. However, this was never simple. The easy part is to prefer people like us over foreigners. Xenophobia is in our DNA. The hard part is to sometimes prefer strangers over friends and relatives. 
    
    Nation-states had to create mammoth apparatus of education, propaganda and flag waving in order to get people to renounce corruption and put national interests before family connections. The problem starts when benign patriotism morphs into chauvinistic ultranationalism, leading to violent conflicts.
    
    By 1964, ‚Äúmake love, not war‚Äù, as already accepted wisdom. Yet the question raised by Johnson in the [‚ÄúDaisy‚Äù advertisement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_(advertisement)) is more pertinent today than it was back in 64. Will we make a world in which all humans can live together, or will we go into the dark?
    
    Nationalist isolationism is probably even more dangerous in the context of climate change than nuclear way. Even in countries that stand to lose much from global warming, nationalists might be too shortsighted and self -absorbed to appreciate the danger. Since there is no national answer to the problem of global warming, some nationalists politicians prefer to believe the problem does not exist. 
    
    Technology has changed everything by creating a set of global existential threats that no nation can solve on its eon. 
    
    Ask politicians: 
    
    - What actions will you take to lessen the risks of nuclear way.
    - What actions will you take to lessen the risks of climate change
    - What actions will you take to regulate disruptive technologies such as AI and bioengineering
    - How do you see the world in 2040?
    - What is your worst-case scenario and best?
    
- **8: Religion**
    
    ### God now serves the nation
    
    Traditional religions are extremely relevant to identify problems but, in most case, they constitute a major part of the problem rather than a potential solution. 
    
    When you compare the economic policies of different religions, you just don‚Äôt see that much of a difference. The real source of their difference will be in modern scientific theories and political movements, no in the Bible. Religion doesn‚Äôt really have much to contribute to the great policy debates of our time.
    
    People‚Äôs identities are a crucial historical force and in the twenty first century religions get to determine who are ‚Äúus‚Äù and who are ‚Äúthem‚Äù, who we should cure and whom we should bomb. 
    
    No matter how archaic a religion might look, with a bit of reinterpretation it can almost always be married to the latest technological gadgets and most sophisticated modern institutions. 
    
    In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, The Japanese state created an official verson of Shinto. They modernized at a breathtaking pace wile simultaneously developing a fanatical loyalty. The best-known sign of success of this was precious guided misses better known as kamikaze. This relied on combining state-of-the-art technology with state-of-the-art religious indoctrination. 
    
    In some cases, states might create a completely new religion, like north Korea. 
    
    All of this makes religion par of humanity‚Äôs problem and not the remedy. 
    
    Humankind now constitutes a single civilization with global level issues, but nationalism and religion still divide us into different and often hostile camps
